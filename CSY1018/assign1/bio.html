   From a young age I was interested in computers and generally in computing.
I remember like yesterday the day my first personal computer arrived home and
how intriguing it was. Since that day my passion for computers started to grow
day by day. I recall of how much I wanted to understand the way computers work.</div>
<div class="b2">
  As I was growing up I became more and more passionate how this great
invention work and realizing the variety of things it can do. Later I began
exploring the Internet and I was fascinated by this whole new world.</div>
<div class="b2">
  In the following years I continued to occupy myself with computers not
only as a hobby such as playing video games but also for school projects. In
school I learned a few things about computing but that was just not enough,
I needed an academic knowledge to fulfil my dreams.</div>
<div class="b2">
  My goal is to explore and understand the world of computing in a way that
will give me the knowledge of working in this field. Especially I am
interested in programming ,website development and managing databases.</div>
<div class="b2">
  Finally I choose to study in a British university because I believe the
British educational system is one the best in Europe and because of the
chance that I have to improve my knowledge in the English language.</div>
